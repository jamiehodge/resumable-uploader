Resumable Uploader
==================

An (incomplete) implementation of Google's [Resumable HTTP Request Proposal](http://code.google.com/p/gears/wiki/ResumableHttpRequestsProposal)
in Sinatra, jQuery and CoffeeScript.

Uploads are uploaded in sequential chunks via AJAX and will eventually be resumable.
